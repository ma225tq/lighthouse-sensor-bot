PONTOS-HUB launched on 2023-04-30, so the data contains datapoints corresponding to a period for which PONTOS-HUB has no data.\n\nEach row in the `ferry_trips_data.csv` files contain fields describing 2 trips between two terminals:\n\n- An `outbound` trip from the departure terminal to the arrival terminal.\n- An `inbound` trip from the arrival terminal to the departure terminal.\n\nThe suffixes `outbound` and `inbound` in the field names indicate to which trip does the field correspond.\n\nHere follows a description of _some_ of the fields as most of them are self-explanatory:\n\nOriginal fields:\n\n- `time_departure`: Time of departure for the outbound trip as recorded by Färjerederiet. Given in Central European Time (CET).\n- `vehicles_left_at_terminal_outbound/inbound`: Number of vehicles left at the terminal on departure for the outbound/inbound trip. _Estimated by the crew._\n- `trip_type`: One of the following types of trip:\n - `ordinary`- Ordinary trip.\n - `doubtful` – An \\\"ordinary\\\" trip that does not match the timetable.\n - `extra` – An extra trip by an additional ferry that does not follow the timetable.\n - `proactive` – A trip made before the ordinary trip to stay ahead, comparable to an extra trip.\n - `doubling` – An extra trip between two regular trips to take care of vehicles left behind in the terminal.\n- `tailored_trip`: A special trip for vehicles with dangerous cargo. (1: True, 0: False).\n- `passenger_car_equivalent_outbound/inbound`: The total number of vehicles in a outbound/inbound trip as Passenger Car Equivalent (PCE) according to the following conversion rules:\n - Length 0-6 meters (e.g., car): 1 PCE\n - Length 6-12 meters (e.g., lorry or car with trailer): 2.5 PCE\n - Length 15-24 meters (e.g., lorry with trailer): 4.5 PCE\n - Bus: 9 PCE\n - Other large vehicles (e.g., cranes, harvesters): 9 PCE\n\nAdditional fields calculated with data from PONTOS-HUB (might not always contain values depending on data availability):\n\n- `distance_outbound/inbound_nm`: Approximate distance travelled in the outbound/inbound trip. Calculated from PONTOS-HUB data and given in nautical miles.\n- `fuelcons_outbound/inbound_l`: Approximate fuel consumption in the outbound/inbound trip. Calculated from PONTOS-HUB data and given in liters.\n- `start_time_outbound/inbound`: Approximate start time of the outbound/inbound trip.
